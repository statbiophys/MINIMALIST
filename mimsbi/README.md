=== Package Information ===
MIMSBI (Mutual Information Estimation for Simulation Based Inference) is a Python3 package to infer neural density estimators with tensorflow code.
The Neural density estimators can be used to evaluate DKL, MI and DJS using only samples from two distributions. Alternatively the density itself can be evaluated. In the case of Simulation Based the Inference the density takes the role of the posterior of the parameters given the observed data. See ref for more details.
